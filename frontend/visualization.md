GEPHI:

Try to export the neo4j graph as GraphML or GEFX, manipulate the properties and import it into Gephi.

To export your data from Neo4j, you can use the APOC library, which provides various procedures for exporting data to different file formats. For example, to export your data to GraphML, you can use the apoc.export.graphml procedure as follows:

  `CALL apoc.export.graphml.all("export.graphml",{})`

This will export all nodes and relationships in your Neo4j database to a file called "export.graphml" in the GraphML format.

Once you have your data in the appropriate format, you can import it into Gephi using the "Import Spreadsheet" feature and select the appropriate file format. Gephi should be able to recognize the file format and import your data accordingly.

After importing your data, you can use Gephi's various tools and algorithms to visualize and analyze your graph.
